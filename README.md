# [Fair or Foul: An EDA of MLB Umpires](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adrienleon/fair-or-foul-an-eda-of-mlb-umpires)
* **Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, StatsModels**
* Analyzed MLB umpire decision-making data from 2015-2022, focusing on game outcomes and umpire accuracy.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by converting data types and handling 120 non-numeric entries, maintaining data integrity.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), including statistical summaries, distribution visualization, and trend analysis over time.
* Investigated umpire performance using scatter plots and statistical tests, revealing significant differences in decision-making accuracy.
* Utilized statistical methods for in-depth analysis, including ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests to compare umpire performance metrics.
* Proposed further research directions, such as umpire-specific analysis and the impact of game situations on umpire calls.

# [Unveiling Sleep Patterns](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adrienleon/unveiling-sleep-patterns)
* Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for in-depth data analysis.
* Analyzed sleep health and lifestyle data from a dataset of over 1,000 entries.
* Preprocessed and inspected dataset to identify and understand key variables.
* Generated descriptive statistics to summarize data trends and patterns.
* Created histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots for visual data exploration.
* Examined sleep patterns across various demographics for comparative insights.
* Investigated sleep disorder characteristics in a subset of the population.

# [Anti-Gravity Object Position Analysis](https://github.com/adrienleon/Anti-Gravity-Object-Position)
* **Tech: R, polynomial regression**
* Validated a physics model of anti-gravity fields using real-world data.
* Employed **R** for data manipulation and visualization.
* Investigated object behavior over 3 time intervals, confirming or refuting the hypothesis.
* Developed a cubic polynomial regression model to confirm the hypothesis.

# [Predictive Modeling for Gestational Age & Hybrid Drivers](https://github.com/adrienleon/Predictive-Modeling-for-Gestational-Age-Hybrid-Drivers)
* **Tech: R, tidyverse, tidymodels, caret, logistic regression**
* Predicted gestational ages using demographic and health data.
* Enhanced predictive models using **R**, achieving a 20% increase in accuracy.
* Utilized **R** and libraries for data analysis and model evaluation.
* Designed data visualizations to clarify complex mathematical concepts.
* Utilized logistic regression, random forest, and LDA to validate model reliability.
* Cross-validated to optimize and ensure model robustness
* Analyzed and curated over 2,000 data points for in-depth evaluation.
