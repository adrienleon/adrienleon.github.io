# [Project 1: Anti-Gravity Object Position Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/adrienleon/Anti-Gravity-Object-Position)
* Tech: R, polynomial regression
* Validated a physics model of anti-gravity fields using real-world data.
* Employed R for data manipulation and visualization.
* Investigated object behavior over 3 time intervals, confirming or refuting the hypothesis.
* Developed a cubic polynomial regression model to confirm the hypothesis.

# [Project 2: Earthquake Magnitude Prediction](https://github.com/adrienleon/Earthquake-Magnitude)
* Tech: R, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting
* Predicted earthquake magnitudes using various modeling techniques.
* Used R for comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling.
* Analyzed 4 variables, including a categorical predictor, to refine model performance.
* Managed data sets, handling over 1,000 data points for robust analysis.

# [Project 3: Predictive Modeling for Gestational Age & Hybrid Drivers](https://github.com/adrienleon/Predictive-Modeling-for-Gestational-Age-Hybrid-Drivers)
* Tech: R, tidyverse, tidymodels, caret, logistic regression
* Predicted gestational ages using demographic and health data.
* Enhanced predictive models using R, achieving a 20% increase in accuracy.
* Utilized R and libraries for data analysis and model evaluation.
* Designed data visualizations to clarify complex mathematical concepts.
* Utilized logistic regression, random forest, and LDA to validate model reliability.
* Cross-validated to optimize and ensure model robustness
* Analyzed and curated over 2,000 data points for in-depth evaluation.
